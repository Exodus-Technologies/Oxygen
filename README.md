# Oxygen

Microservice for all interactions for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting subscription metadata for customers of Sheen magazine (Subscription Manager)

# Requirements

For development, you will only need Node.js and a node global package (NPM) installed in your
environement.

### Node

- #### Node installation on Windows

  Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer. Also, be
  sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git
  [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

- #### Node installation on Ubuntu

  You can install nodejs and npm easily with apt install, just run the following commands.

      $ sudo apt install nodejs
      $ sudo apt install npm

- #### Other Operating Systems
  You can find more information about the installation on the
  [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and the
  [official NPM website](https://npmjs.org/).

If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

    $ node --version
    v14.5.0

    $ npm --version
    6.14.6

If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After running the following
command, just open again the command line and be happy.

    $ npm install npm -g
